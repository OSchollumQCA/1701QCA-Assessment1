## Reading reflections ##
*Reflective reading is an important part of actually making your reading worthwhile. Don't just read the words to understand what they say: read to see how the ideas in the text fit with and potentially change your existing knowledge and maybe even conceptual frameworks. We assume you can basically figure out what the readings mean, but the more important process is to understand how that changes what you think, particularly in the context of your project.*

*For each of the assigned readings, answer the questions below.*

### Reading: Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things, Chapter 1 (The Psychopathology of Everyday Things) ###

Before reading 'The Design of Everyday Things', I believed that an affordance and signifier was the same thing. Whilst reading, I've figured out the difference between the both of them.

I learn't the definitions of both an affordance and signifier. An affordance determines what actions are possible, whereas signifiers communicate where the action should take place.

I would like to learn more about all the different kinds of affordance and signifiers there are and how they work together. 

Reading about affordances and signifiers will help with my contruction of my banana project. By knowing the difference between the two, now I can incorporate that knowlegde into my project.

### Reading: Chapter 1 of Dan Saffer, Microinteractions: Designing with Details, Chapter 1 ###

I had no idea what a Mircointeraction was before reading this chapter. But with the knowledge of understanding, it's easy to pick out what a Mircoininteration really is. 

I've learn't the definition of a Mircointeraction, and how they differ from featues in both their sizes and scope. They are simple, brief and an effortless design technique. I've also learn't what they are good for and where they are needed. 

I found it interesting learning about the structure of Mircointeractions and the different triggers and rules. I'd like to see more exaples of this being used on everyday devices.

This is releavnt to the project I'm working because Mircointeration is used to better user interaction and experience. This is important for my banana project to try an include a Mircointeration to make it easier for the user to use. 

### Reading: Scott Sullivan, Prototyping Interactive Objects ###

I thought before reading into this, that the process of design was plain and simple. Once going in and having a read, I've noticed that it can become a lot more complex. 

I've learnt the process it takes to complete an interactive object and that prototyping is very important for the whole design to work. Their are many challeneges you'll need to overcome when creating a project, and trial and error is key!

I would like to learn/read more examples of people's projects and how their process differs from  Sullivan's project. 

Learning the process is useful for my developing design, being able to overcome obsticals and use trial and error.

## Process documentation

*In this section, include text and images that represent the development of your project including sources you've found (URLs and written references), choices you've made, sketches you've done, iterations completed, materials you've investigated, and code samples. Use the markdown reference for help in formatting the material.*

*This should have quite a lot of information!*

*There will likely by a dozen or so images of the project under construction. The images should help explain why you've made the choices you've made as well as what you have done. Use the code below to include images, and copy it for each image, updating the information for each.*

## Project outcome ##

*Complete the following information.*

### Project title ###

### Project description ###

*In a few sentences, describe what the project is and does, who it is for, and a typical use case.*

### Showcase image ###

*Try to capture the image as if it were in a portfolio, sales material, or project proposal. The project isn't likely to be something that finished, but practice making images that capture the project in that style.*

### Additional view ###

*Provide some other image that gives a viewer a different perspective on the project such as more about how it functions, the project in use, or something else.*

![Image](missingimage.png)

### Reflection ###

*Describe the parts of your project you felt were most successful and the parts that could have done with improvement, whether in terms of outcome, process, or understanding.*


*What techniques, approaches, skills, or information did you find useful from other sources (such as the related projects you identified earlier)?*


*What ideas have you read, heard, or seen that informed your thinking on this project? (Provide references.)*


*What might be an interesting extension of this project? In what other contexts might this project be used?*
